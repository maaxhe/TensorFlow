## ConvNet on CIFAR-10

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is designed to be trained and evaluated on this popular image dataset, providing insights into image classification using deep learning.

### Project Structure

- **Dataset**: The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 different classes. It is automatically downloaded and preprocessed using TensorFlow Datasets.

- **Model**: The model architecture is defined in the `cifar10_cnn` function. It processes input images and outputs class predictions.

- **Training Loop**: The `training_loop` function manages the training process over a specified number of epochs. It updates the model using training data and logs training and validation metrics to TensorBoard.

### Key Files

- **ConvNet On MNIST copy.py**: Main script to create, train, and evaluate the ConvNet model on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

### Setup and Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **TensorFlow**: Ensure you have TensorFlow installed. You can use `pip install tensorflow`.
- **TensorFlow Datasets**: Install it using `pip install tensorflow-datasets`.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for visualizing results. Install using `pip install matplotlib`.
- **Additional Libraries**: NumPy and tqdm.

### Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Load the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow Datasets. Ensure your environment allows TensorFlow to download and cache datasets.

2. **Model Definition**: Define your CNN architecture in the script by calling the `cifar10_cnn()` function.

3. **Training**: Use the `training_loop` function to train the model. It logs the training and validation metrics to TensorBoard.

4. **Monitoring & Evaluation**: Monitor the training process in real-time using TensorBoard. Evaluate the model's performance using validation metrics to adjust hyperparameters if necessary.

### Logging

- **TensorBoard Logs**: Training and validation metrics are saved in the `logs/` directory. Launch TensorBoard by executing `tensorboard --logdir logs/` in your terminal to visualize the training progress.

### Notes

- Ensure your environment is properly set up with all the dependencies installed.
- Make sure to run the notebook in an environment that supports Jupyter Notebook functionalities, including extensions for TensorBoard and tqdm.
